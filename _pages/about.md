My name is Arihwisaks Colin Benedict. I am Mohawk Nation Wolf Clan from the Akwesasne Mohawk territory. I come from the Adams and Benedict families in Akwesasne. I graduated from the Onkwawenna Kentyóhkwa Kanien’kéha immersion program and the Six Nations Polytechnic Bachelor’s of Ongwehoweh Language Program in May 2024. I also graduated from Cornell University in the spring of 2021 with a Bachelor’s of Industrial and Labor Relations. 
Upon my graduation from Onkwawenna Kentyóhkwa I received an advanced-mid score on the ACTFL scale for my language proficiency. I have studied Kanien’kéha language and grammar for 3 years now in a full-time setting, and have learned under nearly a dozen different instructors in introductory and immersion language settings. I have also worked in curriculum design and language translation with first-language speakers at Ahkwesáhsne with the Akwesasne Mohawk Board of Education and Ionkwahronkha’onhákie.  
The goal of my education and career is to help bring Kanien’kéha language transmission back into the homes of Akwesasne within the next 30 years. This means that children will learn their language from their parents, not immersion schools. It also means that adults will be able to go to family members to learn organically, and won’t have to rely on language lessons or curriculum. To make this happen, my community needs to train a generation of adult second-language speakers who can raise their children in this way. The best and most effective way to do that is through the delivery of the Root Word Method curriculum in an Adult Immersion setting.
